# ABCQT_28Qubit-ClusterState
This repository implements the CABQT quantum teleportation protocol using a 28-qubit cluster state. It simulates 2-qubit and 3-qubit teleportation with depolarizing noise and analyzes the impact on fidelity using Qiskit. Visualizations of noise effects are included for better understanding of the protocol's robustness.
